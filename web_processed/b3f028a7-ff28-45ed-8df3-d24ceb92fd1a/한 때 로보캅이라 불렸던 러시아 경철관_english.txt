A man was camping with his friend. Suddenly, extremists shot and killed the friend who was with him. They then found the man's police ID in his wallet and tied his hands behind his back, taking him away. The extremists then started filming him and threatened him to quit his job as a police officer. But the man resisted persistently, and he managed to leave a video message asking his fellow police officers for rescue. Ultimately, he was killed by the extremists.
