A man who had gotten off the bus entered the jewelry store. Afterward, he revealed that he was a robber and threatened the store owner to hand over all the jewelry in the store. However, the customer who was with the store owner realized that the man was actually paralyzed on one side, and didn't take the situation too seriously. They calmly started recording him with their phone. The frustrated man then used his toes to pick up the gun that he had hidden under the counter. But even then, the store owner and the customer thought he wouldn't be able to shoot with his toes. But in that moment, he pulled the slide with his toes and loaded the gun. Only then did they realize he was serious, and the man raised his hands in surrender.
